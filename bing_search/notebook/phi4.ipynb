    "\n",
    "Task Description:\n",
    "Evaluate whether a screenshot downloaded from a search engine matches the specified app based on its name. Assign a score from 1 to 5 and provide a detailed explanation in the format {score}:{reason}. Use the following criteria and examples for guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scoring Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5: The name on the screenshot perfectly matches the app's name, with no discrepancies or errors. The screenshot is undoubtedly associated with the app and describes its core functionality or features.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - ccleaner: \"Piriform CCleaner review | TechRadar\" → 5 : The title directly mentions \"Piriform CCleaner,\" which is the exact name of the app, and the context aligns with the app's functionality as a system cleaning tool.\n",
    "  - windows_defender: \"How to Extract Quarantine Files from Windows Defender | Nikola's Blog\" → 5 : The title clearly identifies \"Windows Defender\" and discusses its quarantine feature, directly related to the app's core functionality.\n",
    "  - roblox: \"Roblox Squid games Tier List (Community Rankings) - TierMaker\" → 5 : The title explicitly references \"Roblox\" and describes community content directly tied to the app.\n",
    "  - spotify: \"3 Spotify Audio Settings That All 188 Million Subscribers Should ...\" → 5 : The title matches \"Spotify\" perfectly, and the content is highly relevant, focusing on audio settings, a core app feature.\n",
    "  - epic_games_launcher: \"How to fix Epic Games launcher slow download speed issue? - DigiStatement\" → 5 : The title directly refers to \"Epic Games Launcher\" and describes a troubleshooting topic specific to the app.\n",
    "- 4: The name on the screenshot is highly relevant to the app, but there are minor formatting differences, ambiguities, or a lack of context that slightly detracts from full certainty.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - windows_update: \"วิธียกเลิกอัพเดท Windows 11 ถอดถอนการติดตั้ง Uninstall Windows Update ...\" → 4 : The title focuses on uninstalling Windows updates, which is relevant to \"Windows Update.\" However, the non-English language and partial phrasing introduce some ambiguity.\n",
    "  - microsoft_powerpoint: \"Accuracy PowerPoint #112746\" → 4 : The title mentions \"PowerPoint\" but lacks specific context or a clear connection to the app's primary purpose.\n",
    "  - windows_settings: \"Персонализация Windows 10 не открывается\" → 4 : The title discusses Windows personalization settings, which are part of \"Windows Settings,\" but it’s specific to a single feature rather than the overall settings.\n",
    "  - windows_desktop: \"Notification Area Icons - not showing any icons - Windows 10 Forums\" → 4 : The title relates to Windows desktop features but does not explicitly identify the app or tool related to \"Windows Desktop.\"\n",
    "  - windows_diagnostics: \"Windows Error Reporting Exposes Your Vulnerabilities | PCMag\" → 4 : The title discusses a diagnostic-related topic in Windows, relevant to \"Windows Diagnostics,\" but could apply to broader system issues.\n",
    "- 3: The name on the screenshot shows some relevance to the app but is unclear, ambiguous, or only partially matches the app's name. The context might suggest indirect relevance, but the connection is weak.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - windows_update: \"Enable or Disable Context Menus in the Start Menu in Windows 10 | Tutorials\" → 3 : The title discusses modifying menus in Windows, which may relate to updates indirectly, but does not directly address \"Windows Update.\"\n",
    "  - mcafee_ui_container: \"Step-by-step Tutorial to Uninstall McAfee from Mac Computers\" → 3 : While it discusses uninstalling McAfee, it does not refer to the \"UI Container\" specifically, making the connection unclear.\n",
    "  - trello: \"Basic bitch’s best free productivity apps in 2020 – Luscious Mind\" → 3 : Trello might be one of the productivity apps mentioned, but the title does not provide clear confirmation or context.\n",
    "  - evernote: \"26 best task management software options | DeskTime Blog\" → 3 : Evernote may be one of the tools included, but the title lacks direct reference or specificity.\n",
    "  - itunes: \"2 Ways to Transfer iTunes Playlists to Another Computer\" → 3 : The title is partially relevant to \"iTunes,\" discussing playlists, but the context is limited.\n",
    "- 2: The name on the screenshot has little relevance to the app, possibly referencing a different app or a highly generic title. There may be superficial connections, but these are weak or coincidental.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - revo_uninstaller: \"Event Viewer Windows 11\" → 2 : The title refers to a generic system tool in Windows, which is loosely related but not specific to \"Revo Uninstaller.\"\n",
    "  - windows_settings: \"Windows 7 Starter And Home Basic Personalization Panel - gHacks Tech News\" → 2 : The title discusses older Windows personalization settings, which are only tangentially related to \"Windows Settings.\"\n",
    "  - obs_studio: \"How to perfect the audio for your first game stream\" → 2 : While the topic might involve OBS Studio, there is no explicit mention of the app, making the connection weak.\n",
    "  - signal: \"Solid Signal Wiring Diagrams\" → 2 : The title references signal wiring diagrams, which are unrelated to \"Signal\" the messaging app, despite the shared keyword.\n",
    "  - bitdefender: \"Avast Premium Security 5 Devices 1 Year Windows/Mac/Android/iOS (Email ...)\" → 2 : The title discusses a competing product, \"Avast,\" which is unrelated to \"Bitdefender.\"\n",
    "- 1: The name on the screenshot is entirely unrelated to the app, with no discernible connection. The content might focus on another app, product, or completely irrelevant topic.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "  - gog_galaxy: \"Google Play Store 2017 - Descargar Video\" → 1 : The title references \"Google Play Store,\" which is entirely unrelated to \"GOG Galaxy.\"\n",
    "  - adobe_acrobat: \"DHP APK Download for Android - Latest Version\" → 1 : The title describes an APK download, unrelated to \"Adobe Acrobat.\"\n",
    "  - vmware_workstation_player: \"How to Change the Wi-Fi Network of the Camera - Yoosee\" → 1 : The title discusses camera Wi-Fi networks, completely irrelevant to VMware Workstation Player.\n",
    "  - windows_file_explorer_extra: \"Basic Functionality of Pandas - Python Geeks\" → 1 : The title discusses Python programming, which has no connection to Windows File Explorer.\n",
    "  - deltaforce: \"Delta Force Hawk Ops Alpha Key: 4 Ways to Get Access\" → 1 : While the title mentions Delta Force, the context is generic and unrelated to any specific app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output strictly follows the pattern below, without any input beyond {score} and {reason} in the specified format for each screenshot evaluation.\n",
